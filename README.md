# 2D/3D Renderer Engine Development

## Project Name
2D/3D Renderer Engine Development

## Technologies
- C++
- OpenGL
- CMake

## Description
In this project, I am developing a high-performance 2D/3D renderer engine aimed at optimizing graphical design and rendering efficiency.

## Details
- **2D Renderer**: Developed a 2D renderer using OpenGL for efficient graphical design.
- **3D Renderer**: Ongoing development of a 3D renderer to enhance visual capabilities.
- **Engine Features**:
  - Event Systems
  - Camera System
  - Batch Rendering
  - Quad Drawing
  - Keyboard and Mouse Input Handling
  - Layer Creation
- **Build and Configuration**: Compiled and configured the project using CMake.

## Goals
- Achieved low hardware requirements through performance optimizations.
- Created a developer-friendly environment with a flexible and modular architecture.
- Aiming for cross-platform support to reach a wide user base.
- Deeply understanding the underlying mathematics of rendering techniques.
