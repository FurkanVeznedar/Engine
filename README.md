# 2D/3D Engine Development

## Project Name
2D/3D Engine Development

## Technologies
- C++
- OpenGL
- CMake

## Description
In this project, I am developing a high-performance engine for finite element analysis (FEA).
The aim is to create an optimized engine for solving structural problems.

## Details
- **2D Renderer**: Developed a 2D renderer using OpenGL for graphical design. Work on the 3D renderer is ongoing.
- **Engine Features**:
  - Event Systems
  - Camera System
  - Batch Rendering
  - Quad Drawing
  - Keyboard and Mouse Input Handling
  - Layer Creation
- **Build and Configuration**: Compiled and configured the project using CMake.

## Goals
- Achieved low hardware requirements through performance optimizations.
- Created a developer-friendly environment with a flexible and modular architecture.
- Aims to reach a wide user base with cross-platform support.
- Aims to deeply understand the math underlying the commercial FEA solvers
